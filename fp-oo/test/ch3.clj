; Our Point function matches the way Python constructors are called. Java would use new Point and
; Ruby would use Point.new. That suggests an alternative syntax:
; (new Point 3 5)
; However, Clojure reserves new for the creation of Java objects, so weâ€™ll use make instead:
; (make Point 1 2)
; Write the function make, assuming that the function Point already exists.
